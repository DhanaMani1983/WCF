Communication:

What is communication?

In older days each and every one were working on individual computers, so for example if you need to take a print out only one machine will be
connected to printer, we need to take documents via floppy to the machine connected to printer, chances are floppy may not work. To overcome this
issue netwroking was introduced.

Networking:

For networking computers were connected with wires or wireless so communication can be established between computers

Protocol:

To establish communication between computer certain standard were established which is protocol.

Communication with same computer:

Different Processes: Communication is not a new concept, it is there since operating system is created. Interaction between different processes is also communication

Inter communication: For example if you insert CD into drive, we get a instant notification asking whether to play contents, this is hapenning via communication between drive and application through operating system,
Similarly when you type in keyboard, key strokes are captured by os and piped to application which is also a communication

Visual Basic for Microsoft Office: using VBA you can program to open excel application, intruct excel application to create workbook etc. These actions are done via communication 

Service Oriented Development

Communication with differentcomputer:

Sepearte machine - Communication can happen different computer within same room, area, or different part of the world, where computer can be connected via wires or wireless
Connected by Intranet/Internet - Computers can be connected via Intranet which is Local area network or via Internet wide area network.
Communication - Goal is to make different computers communicate to each other.

Communcation with different devices:

Different Devices: communication with different computer machines, communication with computer and mobile is possible
Different Technology: Communication with different technologies example between Java app and .Net app, between python interface and ruby interface
How to intercommunicate? WCF was introduced to establish intercommunication between different devices and different technologies. where methods will be exposed for users to consume
