WCF - Communication Terms
######################################################################

Remote procedure call:

RPC (or) RMI - Foundation of communication. If there is C# application, we compile the applicationa and publish the application as a exe
when the exe is run, the functions related to the exe get loaded into the memory space of the computer running the exe. if you need to access 
the memory space of different computer runnning certain application, it can be done through RPC, where the communcation between two different
memory space in two different computers is done via operating system by means of RPC. In Java its called Remote Method Invocation.

COM: In microsoft COM was introduced where within same computer two applications need to communicate we can use COM. 
DCOM: Dynamic Component Object Model. Applications with different computers can access their functionality using DCOM.
Remoting: .Net implementing Remoting.
CORBA, XML-RPC - Different protocols were introduced for communication.
SOAP - Next version XML communication is SOAP. Still lot of communication is done via SOAP.

Endpoint : Important topic in communication is Endpoint. 

If my program is running on a server, If a different machine needs to access my program and its methods we need an endpoint for the different computer to access
my program and its method.

- Address - Endpoint will contain an address, which will be the IP address of the server or computer exposing/hosting the program.

- Binding - which protocol to use for communication, whether its HTTP,TCP/IP

- Contract - We can have multiple methods in a program, but accessibility will be restricted to only certain methods bound by the contract. 

- Proxy/ Stub. After you create a service, the next step is to create a WCF client proxy. A client application uses the WCF client proxy to communicate with the service. 
Client applications usually import a service's metadata to generate WCF client code that can be used to invoke the service.

Client which invokes the remote procedure, will create a local copy of the procedure it invokes. Stub is at the receiving end where its separate the parameters passed(unmarshalling) and sent
it to the procedure.

Message(Method Contract) - Message is a term frequently used in WCF. Message is the request which is passed from client to server which hosts the service.

Communication Mode

One way communication: if you have a device where if it receives a message or intimidation it just passes the message to the server.
Request/Reply: if you type a web address, the request goes to the server and reply comes back from server
Duplex: two way communication, client/server both will take request and responses. 

Data (Data Contract): information which goes from client to server is called parameter. Reply from server is data/data contract. 

Encoding:
