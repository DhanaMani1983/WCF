WCF - Architecture 
######################################################################

Service Oriented Architecture:

1. Contracts - Data Contract, Message Contract, Service Contract, Policy and Binding 

Service contract consists of collection of messages, for each message if there is data it is received using data contract. 

Policy and Binding - Who can access which service, message and data is policy and how can they access if binding 

2. Service Runtime:

When a service is running it has many behaviours which can be

Throttling Behaiour: How many client can access simultaneously?

Error Behaviour: If there is error in service how the client will be notified.

Metadata Behaviour: Information about service given to the client is through metadata behaviour 

Instance behaviour: Information about instance

Message Inspection: What kind/type of message received from client

Transaction Behaviour: Similar to sql transaction, where everything goes or nothing goes. 

Dispatch Behaviourm Concurrency Behaviour, Parameter Filetering 

3. Messaging: How communication would be done via messaging

WS Security Channel, WS Reliable Messaging Channel, Encoders Binary/MTOM,XML, HTTP Channel

4. Activation and hosting 

Windows actication service, .exe, windows service, com+.

WCF Benefits:

Asynchronous one way messaging: 

Support for Cross vendor interoperability

Reliability

Platform ConsolidationL
  Web Service

  Enterprise Services (COM+)

 Microsoft Messaging Queue(MSMQ)

Explicit support for Service Oriented Development
