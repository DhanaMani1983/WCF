WCF - Ajax RPC
######################################################################

1. Open Visual studio, create an empty web application project .

2. Adding WCF service
   Group services under a folder, so create a folder named services
   Right click new folder, add services and name it appropriately.
3. Looking into service interface. 
   when you add wcf service, an interface gets created which is the service contract. 
   only methods/functions in service contract is exposed to public 
   service contract can have multiple functions, but only functions which is marked as operation contract
   will be available to public. 
4. How the service interface is implemented.
   Use cntrl + . to implement interface
   In the class which implements interface add appropriate code 
5. Special care for JSON return 
   For Ajax/Jquery call to a service function will need json format, so to get the output in json format
   we need to add web invoke method. add class library servicemodel.web to include the classes need for web invoke. 
6. Configuring WCF services- Most typical part is configuration of wcf services, it plays a important part 
   web.config: when you add a service, certain configurations gets added to web.config. these configurations are
   system.servicemodel which has behaviours which is about the applications and what behaviour it should include.
   also it includes common configuration 
7. Configure our services: how to expose the service 
   Services 
     Service
       Endpoint - For inter operability purpose we can expose the service as rest api, wshttp, tcp, named pipe
                  We can have seperate endpoints for java apps, python apps etc
   Service behaviour
   Endpoint behaviour 
   Before configurin the project build the project, only then dll will be created in bin folder 
   Right click web.config and click edit wcf configurations. A new popup window will open, click create new service 
   In the service type, browse and select the service dll from the bin folder. it will list the service types available, select the appropriate service type
   Next Select the interface/service contract to expose 
   Next select the communication mode which can be HTTP.
   Next select interoperability, select basic if you want to expose as web api's 
   Next select the endpoint 
 Once configuration is finished new services section will appear in web.config 
 Basic http binding will not support json so we use web http binding 
 Just like service behaviour, we can have end point behaviour. If there are multiple service for which we have created different endpoint
 if each endpoint has unique behaviour we can create seperate end point behaviour with unique name and attach behaviour name to the service
8. Adding default aspx page
9. set the default page as start up page. run the application to load default page with button. navigate to http://localhost/services/servicename.svc
to check whether service is running.
using ajax invoke the service
