WCF - Service Oriented Application
######################################################################
1.Benefits

For Jquery to invoke a web service, the service must be on same project. Isolating service on 
different project or machine is called service oriented architecture

Able to run on different machine
Easily apply Company policy
Easily redistribute access to client.

2. Adding service library to solution - To add service library, right click solution and select wcf service library

3. Analyse the configuration file. 

4. App.config for WCF configuration - In app.config you will have service model, within it you will have services
   When you add wcf as seperate project, new port number and http address gets assigned for the service
   also new endpoint gets added. you need to mex attribute set for the endpoint for meta data exchangem only using mex
   service can be consumed

5. Simple interest service - To learn in details watch the video for more understanding
To add custom service, remove the default service from the project. Add new service and name it SimpleInterest.
Add methods to extend in the interface, implement the interface in the class.

In app.config new service endpoint will be created for the new service

6. Service Reference
How to add service reference: If there is a remoted procedure/service in a server, the information about the service
is given to the client through wsdl. To add service reference, Build the service project first. 
right service reference on project where to add the reference
and select discover. It will list the services available in the solution, select the service to add and give a name. 

7. Analyse configuration
Go to web.config to analyse service model, within service model you have services, endpoint etc 

8. Auto hosting
Auto hosting provision by microsoft - when you right click a project and select properties. you will see wcf options 
you will see ticked option start wcf service host when debugging another project in the same solution 
when a web project start, microsoft in built functionality will host wcf automatically. In os tab you can see two settings sign
showing wcf service has started.

Testing the wcf librart service: click the double settings sign in task bar and select meta data address

9. Note binding address

what is the default binding address? To verify in command line use - netsh http show urlacl

10. WCF Test client: Using autohost service gets hosted in iis, to test whether the service is running properly you can use WCF Test client
which can be found in location C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\WCFTestClient.exe
run the application/project, copy the metadata address by selecting double settings symbol from task bar.
paste the address in wcf test client and invoke to run the service 

11. Create Proxy in web project:
Create proxy in web project: while adding service reference, you would have given alias the for reference. using the alias create a proxy
as below. using the proxy one can access the service methods

            SimpleInterestService.SimpleInterestClient proxy = 
                new SimpleInterestService.SimpleInterestClient();
            double res = proxy.Calculate(50000, 18, 3);
            lblResult.Text = "Simple Interest : " + res.ToString();
            proxy.Close();

When a service gets added you can create your own endpoint behaviour to match the http binding 

12. WCF Configuration Tool:

This is a important configuration tool, you can right click service app.config and select edit wcf configuration
