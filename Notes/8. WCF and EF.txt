WCF - WCF and EF
######################################################################

1. Creating a data project:
To create a data project, add class library and name wcftraining.data
To install EF go to nuget packages and install latest version of EF.
To add DBcontext, right click on the project add new item then select data and select ADO.net ef

2. Adding method to service

To add a method to return list of customers. Add data project reference to service project 
Create a interface method getCustomers to return list of customers.
Implement the getCustomers method 
Add database configuration to the service project 

3. Testing WCF EF

Once new methods are added to the service. Update service reference. In certain cases like returnin objects from EF.
The returned object is of type dynamic proxies. you wouldn't be able to serialize the object and send it to the client.
To do it we need to do additional settings 


4. POCO - very important when it comes to WCF.

Plain old CLR object - There is a risk that if you expose the object returned by EF to client. the client may 
do some modification to the object. To avoid it EF has evolved. 

Each EF will have context.tt and plain old .tt file. where .tt is proxied as context.tt. To support WCF we can 
turn off context.tt. Go to the contructor of the context.tt and set this.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;

when you disable the ProxyCreationEnabled, object returned will be POCO and not proxy enabled object

5. Cannot serialize proxy objects:

WCF cannot serialize proxy objects, shut off porxy creations 

6. Moving POCO to Model project

Why? clear seperation, can introduce business layer 

7. Creating model class library

Add new class library, add reference for EF 

8. Add fluent context -

Right click model project, add new item, type ef 5. should filter ef 5.x DBContext fluent. Give it a name and add it.

Delete context and mappint and leave entities. You need to specify edmx file as input in the entities 

Delete the tt file in data project and add reference to model project in data reference
